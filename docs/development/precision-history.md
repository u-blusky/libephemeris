## Completed Fixes

### PREC_RATE / PREC_RATE_QUAD Regression Bug (Critical)

**File:** `libephemeris/planets.py`, function `_calc_ayanamsa()`

**Problem:**
The variables `PREC_RATE` and `PREC_RATE_QUAD` were used in the `ayanamsha_data`
dictionary and in the general ayanamsha calculation formula, but **were not defined
anywhere** in the code. The new constants `_PREC_C1`–`_PREC_C5` (IAU 2006) had
been defined correctly but the old names had not been updated.

This caused a `NameError` at runtime for **all** formula-based ayanamshas
(Lahiri, Fagan-Bradley, Raman, etc.) and for `SE_SIDM_SURYASIDDHANTA_MSUN`.

Additionally, the original coefficients were slightly inaccurate
(`PREC_RATE` = 5028.796273 was off by +0.000078″/cy from IAU 2006;
`PREC_RATE_QUAD` = 1.105608 was off by +0.000173″/cy²), and the formula
was truncated at 2 terms, missing T³, T⁴, and T⁵.

**Fix applied (3 locations):**

**1. `SE_SIDM_SURYASIDDHANTA_MSUN`** — replaced `PREC_RATE` with `_PREC_C1`:

```python
# Before (BROKEN):
SE_SIDM_SURYASIDDHANTA_MSUN: (20.680425, PREC_RATE),

# After (FIXED):
SE_SIDM_SURYASIDDHANTA_MSUN: (20.680425, _PREC_C1),
```

**2. General ayanamsha formula** — replaced the 2-term formula with the full
5-term IAU 2006 polynomial:

```python
# Before (BROKEN — PREC_RATE_QUAD undefined):
ayanamsa = aya_j2000 + (precession * T + PREC_RATE_QUAD * T * T) / 3600.0

# After (FIXED — full IAU 2006 polynomial):
precession_arcsec = (
    _PREC_C1 * T          # 5028.796195  "/cy
    + _PREC_C2 * T**2     # 1.1054348    "/cy²
    + _PREC_C3 * T**3     # 0.00007964   "/cy³
    + _PREC_C4 * T**4     # -0.000023857 "/cy⁴
    + _PREC_C5 * T**5     # -0.0000000383"/cy⁵
)
ayanamsa = aya_j2000 + precession_arcsec / 3600.0
```

**3. `SE_SIDM_J2000`** — upgraded from 2 terms to 5 terms:

```python
# Before:
val = (5028.796195 * T + 1.1054348 * T**2) / 3600.0

# After:
val = (_PREC_C1 * T + _PREC_C2 * T**2 + _PREC_C3 * T**3
       + _PREC_C4 * T**4 + _PREC_C5 * T**5) / 3600.0
```

**Impact:**

- **Before:** `NameError` for all formula-based ayanamshas (total crash)
- **After:** Correct operation with IAU 2006 precision up to the T⁵ term

### Nutation Unification to IAU 2006/2000A

**Files:** `libephemeris/planets.py`, `libephemeris/utils.py`

**Problem:**
The main nutation path (`cache.py`) had already been updated to `erfa.nut06a()`,
but 4 secondary code paths still used Skyfield's `iau2000b_radians` (77 terms,
~1 mas), creating a ~1 mas inconsistency with GAST and obliquity in house
calculations. Internally, Skyfield uses `iau2000a_radians` (1365 terms, ~0.1 mas)
for `t.gast` and `ecliptic_frame`, so mixing IAU 2000B in other paths introduced
systematic discrepancies.

**Fix applied:**

| Location | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `planets.py:_get_true_ayanamsa()` | `iau2000b_radians(t_obj)` | `erfa.nut06a(2451545.0, t_obj.tt - 2451545.0)` |
| `planets.py:_calc_ayanamsa_ex()` | `iau2000b_radians(t_obj)` | `erfa.nut06a(2451545.0, tjd_tt - 2451545.0)` |
| `utils.py:azalt()` | `iau2000b_radians(t)` | `erfa.nut06a(2451545.0, jd_tt - 2451545.0)` |
| `utils.py:azalt_rev()` | `iau2000b_radians(t)` | `erfa.nut06a(2451545.0, jd_tt - 2451545.0)` |

The import `from skyfield.nutationlib import iau2000b_radians` was removed from
`planets.py` (no longer used). `import erfa` was added to `utils.py`.

**Impact:**

- **Before:** ~1 mas inconsistency between code paths (IAU 2000B, 77 terms)
- **After:** ~0.01–0.05 mas uniform precision (IAU 2006/2000A via pyerfa)

---

### Obliquity Unification to IAU 2006

**Files:** `libephemeris/planets.py`, `libephemeris/utils.py`

**Problem:**
Three different formulas for mean obliquity were in use:

| Location | Formula | Constant |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `cache.py` (houses, ayanamsha) | IAU 2006 via `erfa.obl06()` | 84381.406″ (already fixed) |
| `_calc_ayanamsa_ex()` | Laskar 1986 (`23.43929111` = `84381.448″`) | 84381.448″ |
| `utils.py:azalt/azalt_rev` | Mixed (IAU 2006 constant but only 3 terms) | 84381.406″ (incomplete) |

The critical path (houses, ayanamsha) used Laskar 1986, with a constant offset of
**0.042″** from IAU 2006 and missing terms (T⁴, T⁵).

**Fix applied:**

**1. `_calc_ayanamsa_ex()`** — replaced Laskar 1986 formula with `erfa.obl06()`:

```python
# Before:
eps0 = 23.43929111 - (46.8150 + (0.00059 - 0.001813 * T) * T) * T / 3600.0
dpsi_rad, deps_rad = iau2000b_radians(t_obj)

# After:
eps0 = math.degrees(erfa.obl06(2451545.0, tjd_tt - 2451545.0))
dpsi_rad, deps_rad = erfa.nut06a(2451545.0, tjd_tt - 2451545.0)
```

**2. `utils.py:azalt()` and `azalt_rev()`** — replaced manual formula with
`erfa.obl06()`:

```python
# Before (3 terms, missing T⁴ and T⁵):
eps0 = (84381.406 - 46.836769 * T - 0.0001831 * T*T + 0.00200340 * T*T*T) / 3600.0
dpsi_rad, deps_rad = iau2000b_radians(t)

# After:
eps0_rad = erfa.obl06(2451545.0, jd_tt - 2451545.0)
eps0 = math.degrees(eps0_rad)
dpsi_rad, deps_rad = erfa.nut06a(2451545.0, jd_tt - 2451545.0)
```

**Impact:**

- **Before:** 0.042″ constant offset (Laskar vs IAU 2006) + missing T⁴/T⁵ terms
- **After:** Consistent IAU 2006 obliquity everywhere via pyerfa

---

### Precession Upgrade to IAU 2006 + Frame Bias

**File:** `libephemeris/planets.py`, function `_get_star_position_ecliptic()`

**Problem:**
The precession coefficients zeta/z/theta used values from **Lieske 1977 (IAU 1976)**,
not IAU 2006. The code comment erroneously declared "IAU 2006 precession formulas".
Additionally, the GCRS→J2000 frame bias (~23 mas) was missing.

```python
# Original code (Lieske 1977, NOT IAU 2006):
zeta  = (2306.2181 * T + 0.30188 * T**2 + 0.017998 * T**3) / 3600.0
z     = (2306.2181 * T + 1.09468 * T**2 + 0.018203 * T**3) / 3600.0
theta = (2004.3109 * T - 0.42665 * T**2 - 0.041833 * T**3) / 3600.0
```

The correct IAU 2006 coefficients (Capitaine et al. 2003, A&A 412, Table 1)
include constant terms (±2.650545″) that encode the frame bias:

```python
zeta  = (2.650545 + 2306.083227 * T + 1.0967790 * T**2
         + 0.01860606 * T**3 - 0.000013 * T**4
         - 0.0000005 * T**5) / 3600.0
z     = (-2.650545 + 2306.077181 * T + 1.0927348 * T**2
         + 0.01826837 * T**3 - 0.000028 * T**4
         - 0.0000003 * T**5) / 3600.0
theta = (2004.191903 * T - 0.4294934 * T**2
         - 0.04182264 * T**3 - 0.000007089 * T**4
         - 0.0000001274 * T**5) / 3600.0
```

Dead code was also present (scalar A/B/C calculation that was never used,
overwritten by the subsequent rotation matrix).

**Intermediate fix:**
The entire manual precession block (Lieske 1977 + scalar rotations + dead code)
was replaced with `erfa.pmat06()`:

```python
# Precession-bias matrix IAU 2006 (includes frame bias)
rbp = erfa.pmat06(2451545.0, tjd_tt - 2451545.0)

# Application: P_date = rbp @ P_J2000
x3 = rbp[0][0] * x0 + rbp[0][1] * y0 + rbp[0][2] * z0
y3 = rbp[1][0] * x0 + rbp[1][1] * y0 + rbp[1][2] * z0
z3 = rbp[2][0] * x0 + rbp[2][1] * y0 + rbp[2][2] * z0
```

`erfa.pmat06()` automatically includes:
- Frame bias GCRS→J2000 (~23 mas, the constant terms ±2.650545″)
- IAU 2006 precession with all terms up to T⁵
- Exact coefficients from Capitaine et al. 2003

**Final fix:**
This intermediate fix was subsequently superseded by the complete rewrite of
`_get_star_position_ecliptic()` as part of the annual aberration fix (see below).
The `erfa.pmat06()` code was maintained as an intermediate solution but then
replaced by the Skyfield pipeline, which handles precession internally.

**Impact:**

- **Before:** Lieske 1977 (~0.1″/century) + missing frame bias (~23 mas)
- **After:** Exact IAU 2006 with frame bias included

---

### Annual Aberration in Star-Based Ayanamsha

**File:** `libephemeris/planets.py`, function `_get_star_position_ecliptic()`

**Problem:**
The function computed the ecliptic position of reference stars (Spica, Revati, etc.)
for star-based ayanamshas (True Citra, True Revati, True Pushya, etc.) without
applying **annual aberration** (~20.5″, Bradley's aberration constant).
For comparison, `fixed_stars.py` correctly applied aberration using Skyfield's
`astrometric.apparent()`.

The original implementation consisted of ~130 lines of manual code:
1. Proper motion with 3D vector (Hipparcos Vol. 1, Sec. 1.5.5)
2. Precession with scalar formulas (Lieske 1977) + rotation matrix
3. Manual ecliptic conversion with obliquity

All without aberration, and with Lieske 1977 instead of IAU 2006.

**Fix applied (Option B — recommended in TODO):**
The entire function (~130 lines) was rewritten to use the Skyfield pipeline:

```python
def _get_star_position_ecliptic(star, tjd_tt, eps_true):
    star_obj = Star(
        ra_hours=star.ra_j2000 / 15.0,
        dec_degrees=star.dec_j2000,
        ra_mas_per_year=star.pm_ra * 1000.0,
        dec_mas_per_year=star.pm_dec * 1000.0,
        parallax_mas=star.parallax * 1000.0 if star.parallax > 0 else 0.0,
        radial_km_per_s=star.radial_velocity,
    )

    planets = get_planets()
    ts = get_timescale()
    t = ts.tt_jd(tjd_tt)
    earth = planets["earth"]

    pos = earth.at(t).observe(star_obj).apparent()
    lat, lon, dist = pos.frame_latlon(ecliptic_frame)

    return lon.degrees
```

The Skyfield pipeline `observe().apparent().frame_latlon()` automatically includes
7 effects:
- **Proper motion** (rigorous propagation with radial velocity)
- **Light-time correction** (light propagation time)
- **Annual aberration** (~20.5″ — the primary fix)
- **Gravitational deflection** (gravitational light bending)
- **Precession IAU 2006** (with GCRS→J2000 frame bias)
- **Nutation IAU 2000A** (1365 terms, ~0.1 mas)
- **Ecliptic transformation** (true ecliptic of date)

**Dead code removed:**

- ~80 lines of manual proper motion propagation
- ~50 lines of manual precession (Lieske 1977 + rotations)
- Scalar dead code A/B/C (including a `# Wait, this is incomplete` comment)
- Manual ecliptic conversion with obliquity

This fix simultaneously resolved the aberration issue, the precession upgrade,
the frame bias, and the dead code cleanup.

**Impact:**

- **Before:** up to 20.5″ error (missing aberration) + ~0.1″/cy (Lieske) + ~23 mas (frame bias)
- **After:** sub-milliarcsecond precision (all handled by Skyfield)

---

### Central Difference Velocity

**Files:** `planets.py`, `hypothetical.py`, `spk.py`, `planetary_moons.py`

**Problem:**
All non-planetary velocities used **forward difference** O(h):
```
f'(x) ≈ (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h
```
instead of **central difference** O(h²):
```
f'(x) ≈ (f(x+h) - f(x-h)) / (2h)
```

Central difference provides ~100× better precision for the same timestep.

Additionally, the velocity correction for the ayanamsha rate used forward difference
even in code paths where the primary velocity already used central difference.

**Fix applied:**

#### 7a — Central difference for non-planetary bodies

| File | Body | Method before | Method after |
|------|------|---------------|--------------|
| `hypothetical.py` | Uranian bodies (Cupido–Poseidon) | Forward 1s | Central 1s |
| `hypothetical.py` | Transpluto | Forward 1 day | Central 1 day |
| `hypothetical.py` | Vulcan | Forward 1 day | Central 1 day |
| `hypothetical.py` | Planet X Lowell | Forward 1 day | Central 1 day |
| `hypothetical.py` | Planet X Pickering | Forward 1 day | Central 1 day |
| `spk.py` | SPK Type 2/3 fallback | Forward 1s | Central 1s |
| `planetary_moons.py` | Planetary moons | Forward 1s | Central 1s |

Example transformation (Transpluto):

```python
# Before (forward difference):
pos_next = _calc_transpluto_raw(jd_tt + dt_step)
dlon = pos_next[0] - longitude

# After (central difference):
pos_prev = _calc_transpluto_raw(jd_tt - dt_step)
pos_next = _calc_transpluto_raw(jd_tt + dt_step)
dlon = (pos_next[0] - pos_prev[0]) / (2.0 * dt_step)
```

#### 7b — Ayanamsha rate correction with central difference

**7 occurrences** in `planets.py` (lines 1046, 1142, 1176, 1226, 1258, 1309, 1772)
where the velocity correction for the ayanamsha rate used forward difference:

```python
# Before (forward difference):
ayanamsa_next = _get_true_ayanamsa(t.ut1 + dt)
da = (ayanamsa_next - ayanamsa) / dt

# After (central difference):
ayanamsa_prev = _get_true_ayanamsa(t.ut1 - dt)
ayanamsa_next = _get_true_ayanamsa(t.ut1 + dt)
da = (ayanamsa_next - ayanamsa_prev) / (2.0 * dt)
```

**Impact:**

- **Secondary body velocities:** ~100× precision improvement for the same timestep
- **Ayanamsha rate:** consistent O(h²) everywhere, eliminated inconsistency with primary velocity

---

### Cleanup and Code Restoration

#### Dead code in `_get_star_position_ecliptic()` — Resolved

The scalar A/B/C calculation (which also contained a `# Wait, this is incomplete`
comment) and all manual propagation code were removed as part of the Skyfield
rewrite (annual aberration fix above).

#### Dead function `_calc_star_based_ayanamsha()` — Not touched

The function still exists but is never called. It was not removed to minimize
risk, since it could serve as a future reference.

#### Stale comment in `planets.py:34` — Already fixed

Had already been corrected prior to this work.

#### Obliquity in `_calc_ayanamsa()` — Already fixed

Had already been corrected prior to this work (uses `erfa.obl06()`).

#### Accidentally removed code — Restored

During editing of `planets.py`, three functions and one class were accidentally
removed (located between `_calc_body_special` and `_calc_body`):

- `NutationFallbackWarning` (class) — Warning for degraded precision
- `get_nutation_model()` — Check of the active nutation model
- `_calc_nutation_obliquity()` — Nutation/obliquity calculation for `SE_ECL_NUT`
- `_maybe_equatorial_convert()` — Ecliptic→equatorial conversion

All four were **restored**, and `_calc_nutation_obliquity()` was updated to use
`erfa.obl06()` and `erfa.nut06a()` instead of Skyfield.

## Investigations: ELP2000 Perturbations Not Applied

### True Node (SE_TRUE_NODE)

**File:** `libephemeris/lunar.py`, `calc_true_lunar_node()`

**Investigation:**
The function `_calc_elp2000_node_perturbations()` (900+ lines, 170+ terms) exists
in the file and was conceived as a correction to the geometric node. However,
investigation revealed that:

1. The ELP2000 perturbation series is designed to correct the **mean node**,
   not the geometric node calculated with `h = r × v`
2. The geometric node already captures perturbations through the JPL DE state
   vectors (which include all planetary perturbations)
3. Direct application of the series to the geometric node produced erroneous
   results (deviations of tens of degrees)

**Decision: NOT APPLIED.** An explanatory comment was added to the code:

```python
# Note: ELP2000-82B perturbation corrections (_calc_elp2000_node_perturbations)
# are available but not applied here. The geometric h = r × v approach already
# captures perturbation effects through the JPL DE ephemeris state vectors.
# The perturbation series was designed for the mean node, not the geometric node.
```

**Residual error:** ~8.9″ vs SWE remains.

---

### True Lilith (SE_OSCU_APOG)

**File:** `libephemeris/lunar.py`, `calc_true_lilith()`

**Investigation:**
Analogous situation to True Node. The function `_calc_elp2000_apogee_perturbations()`
(~50 terms) is designed for the **interpolated apogee** (mean apogee, `SE_INTP_APOG`),
not for the osculating apogee calculated with the eccentricity vector
`e = (v×h)/μ − r/|r|`.

The eccentricity vector approach uses a two-body model (Earth-Moon), ignoring
the solar perturbation that causes oscillations up to ~30° in the eccentricity
vector. SWE itself considers the osculating apogee "somewhat artificial" but
still produces more stable results.

**Decision: NOT APPLIED.** An explanatory comment was added:

```python
# Note: ELP2000/Moshier perturbation corrections (_calc_elp2000_apogee_perturbations)
# are available but not applied here. The perturbation series was designed for the
# interpolated (mean) apogee, not the osculating eccentricity vector.
```

**Residual error:** ~54″ vs SWE remains.

---

## Open Opportunities

### Analytical Chebyshev Velocities

**Impact: Moon ~0.001 deg/day; planets smaller but systematic. Performance ~3×.**

**File:** `libephemeris/planets.py`

All planetary velocities are currently calculated with numerical finite-difference
(central difference O(h²)). Skyfield/jplephem provides analytical ICRS velocities
from differentiation of the DE440 Chebyshev polynomials, which are already used
for COB corrections but **not** for angular ecliptic velocities.

**Proposed approach** — obtain position and velocity from Skyfield and compute
angular velocity with exact derivatives:

```python
r_ecl, v_ecl = pos.frame_xyz_and_velocity(ecliptic_frame)
x, y, z = r_ecl.au
vx, vy, vz = v_ecl.au_per_d

xy_sq = x * x + y * y
r_sq = xy_sq + z * z
xy = math.sqrt(xy_sq)
r = math.sqrt(r_sq)

speed_lon = math.degrees((x * vy - y * vx) / xy_sq)         # dλ/dt
speed_lat = math.degrees((z * (x*vx + y*vy) / xy - xy * vz) / r_sq)  # dβ/dt
speed_dist = (x * vx + y * vy + z * vz) / r                  # dr/dt
```

This approach is already implemented for:
- SPK Type 21 (`spk.py:1006–1023`)
- Fixed stars (`fixed_stars.py:3491–3530`)

Extending it to all standard planets would eliminate the 2 recursive `_calc_body()`
calls currently used for finite-difference, yielding ~3× performance improvement.

---

### True Node Precision Improvement

**Current residual:** ~8.9″ vs SWE.

To reduce the residual error, two approaches were identified:

1. **Systematic offset calibration** — compare with SWE on a sample of dates
   across the full DE440 range and derive an empirical correction function
2. **Osculating orbital elements** — implement integration of osculating orbital
   elements as SWE does internally, rather than using the geometric
   `h = r × v` approach

---

### True Lilith Precision Improvement

**Current residual:** ~54″ vs SWE. **Target:** <10″.

Two approaches were identified:

1. Apply `_calc_elp2000_apogee_perturbations()` (~50 terms) to the eccentricity
   vector result as a perturbative correction (requires calibration)
2. Include the solar tidal force in the eccentricity vector calculation,
   transforming the problem from two-body to restricted three-body

---

## Overall Precision Impact

### Before/After Comparison

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Star-based ayanamsha** | up to 20.5″ error (no aberration) | < 0.1″ (full Skyfield pipeline) | ~200× |
| **Nutation** | ~1 mas (IAU 2000B, 77 terms) | ~0.01–0.05 mas (IAU 2006/2000A, pyerfa) | ~20–100× |
| **Obliquity** | 0.042″ offset + inter-path inconsistency | Consistent IAU 2006 everywhere | Offset eliminated |
| **Ayanamsha precession** | 2 terms (T, T²) | 5 terms (T–T⁵), exact IAU 2006 coefficients | Systematic error eliminated |
| **Stellar precession** | Lieske 1977 (~0.1″/cy) + no frame bias | IAU 2006 via Skyfield (sub-mas) | ~1000× |
| **Frame bias GCRS→J2000** | Missing (~23 mas) | Included automatically | 23 mas eliminated |
| **Secondary body velocities** | Forward difference O(h) | Central difference O(h²) | ~100× |
| **Ayanamsha rate** | Forward difference (7 locations) | Central difference everywhere | Consistency |
| **Formula-based ayanamsha crash** | `NameError` on all modes | Correct operation | Critical |

### Remaining Gaps

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| True Node vs SWE | ~8.9″ | < 1″ |
| True Lilith vs SWE | ~54″ | < 10″ |
| Planetary velocities | Central diff O(h²) | Analytical Chebyshev (~3× perf) |

### IAU Models Used

## Files Modified

| File | Lines changed (approx.) | Issues resolved |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|
| `libephemeris/planets.py` | ~400 | Aberration, nutation, obliquity, PREC_RATE regression, precession, frame bias, central diff, cleanup |
| `libephemeris/utils.py` | ~40 | Nutation, obliquity |
| `libephemeris/lunar.py` | ~10 | True Node / True Lilith investigation notes |
| `libephemeris/hypothetical.py` | ~60 | Central difference velocity |
| `libephemeris/spk.py` | ~40 | Central difference velocity |
| `libephemeris/planetary_moons.py` | ~40 | Central difference velocity |

**Files not modified:** `astrometry.py` (already fixed), `fixed_stars.py` (already correct).

## pyerfa Dependency

**pyerfa** (`>=2.0.0`) is used as a required dependency.

| pyerfa function | Usage | Precision |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| `erfa.nut06a()` | Nutation in 4 code paths | ~0.01–0.05 mas |
| `erfa.obl06()` | Obliquity in 3 code paths | Sub-mas |
| `erfa.pmat06()` | Stellar precession (now via Skyfield) | Sub-mas |

Footprint is ~2 MB, pure C (IAU ERFA/SOFA wrapper), no significant transitive
dependencies.
