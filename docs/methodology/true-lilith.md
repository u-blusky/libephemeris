# True Lilith (Osculating Lunar Apogee) Calculation

LibEphemeris computes the osculating lunar apogee (True Lilith) by deriving instantaneous Keplerian orbital elements from the Moon's geocentric state vectors obtained via JPL DE440/DE441, with calibrated perturbation corrections applied to achieve sub-arcminute agreement with Swiss Ephemeris.

## Background

True Lilith, also known as the osculating lunar apogee, is the apogee point of the Moon's instantaneous (osculating) Keplerian orbit. Unlike Mean Lilith (which moves smoothly along the mean lunar orbit), True Lilith oscillates significantly due to solar gravitational perturbations.

The standard method for computing the osculating apogee derives it directly from the Moon's **position and velocity vectors** (state vectors), from which the full set of osculating Keplerian orbital elements is obtained. This avoids the error introduced by analytical approximations and works directly with the numerical ephemeris. Both Swiss Ephemeris (via `SE_OSCU_APOG`) and LibEphemeris use this approach.

### Physical Context

The lunar orbit is far from a simple Keplerian ellipse because it is strongly perturbed by solar gravity (three-body problem). When the osculating ellipse is computed from instantaneous state vectors, the resulting apogee direction oscillates with the period of a synodic month as the Sun's tidal influence alternately stretches and compresses the apparent orbital ellipse.

Key characteristics of the osculating apogee:

1. **Two-Body Approximation**: The osculating apogee treats the Moon's orbit as a simple Keplerian ellipse (two-body problem: Earth and Moon only).

2. **Large Oscillations**: The osculating apogee oscillates **+/- 30 degrees** around the mean apogee. This is an artifact of the insufficient two-body model when applied to the strongly perturbed Earth-Moon-Sun system.

3. **Not a Real Motion**: The 30-degree oscillation does not represent actual motion of the lunar apsides. It is a mathematical consequence of forcing the three-body Earth-Moon-Sun system into a two-body framework.

4. **Instantaneous Validity**: The osculating apogee coincides with actual lunar maximum distance only twice per month — at conjunction and opposition with the Moon.

This is a well-understood artifact of the osculating-elements formalism, documented in standard celestial mechanics texts (Brouwer & Clemence 1961; Murray & Dermott 1999). The +/-30 degree monthly swing reflects the strength of solar perturbations, not real apsidal motion.

## Method

LibEphemeris implements two equivalent approaches in `lunar.py`:

### 1. Eccentricity Vector Method

The primary method (`calc_true_lilith`) computes the apogee direction from the eccentricity vector:

```
Algorithm:
1. Get Moon's geocentric position (r) and velocity (v) from JPL DE ephemeris
2. Compute angular momentum: h = r x v
3. Compute eccentricity vector: e = (v x h)/mu - r/|r| (points toward perigee)
4. Apply solar gravitational perturbation to eccentricity vector direction
5. Apogee direction = -e (opposite to perigee)
6. Transform to ecliptic coordinates with precession and nutation
7. Apply perturbation corrections (evection, variation, annual equation, etc.)
```

### 2. Orbital Elements Method

The alternative method (`calc_true_lilith_orbital_elements`) derives the apogee from classical orbital elements:

```
Algorithm:
1. Get Moon's geocentric state vectors from JPL DE ephemeris
2. Compute angular momentum vector h = r x v
3. Compute node vector n = k x h (perpendicular to orbital plane)
4. Compute eccentricity vector e = (v x h)/mu - r/|r|
5. Derive orbital elements: Omega (node), omega (argument of perigee), i (inclination)
6. Apogee longitude = Omega + omega + 180 degrees
7. Apply coordinate transformations and perturbation corrections
```

### Perturbation Corrections

LibEphemeris applies seven corrections to improve accuracy:

1. **Solar Gravitational Perturbation on Eccentricity Vector**: Direct rotation of the eccentricity vector based on solar tidal quadrupole (amplitude ~0.01148)

2. **Evection Correction**: period ~31.8 days, amplitude ~1.274 degrees
   Argument: 2D - M' (twice mean elongation minus Moon's mean anomaly)

3. **Evection-Related Secondary Terms**: From Meeus Table 47.B
   - M' - 2D: amplitude -0.2136 degrees
   - M' + 2D: amplitude +0.1058 degrees
   - 2M': amplitude -0.2037 degrees
   - 2M' - 2D: amplitude +0.1027 degrees

4. **Variation Correction**: period ~14.77 days, amplitude ~0.658 degrees
   Argument: 2D (twice mean elongation)

5. **Annual Equation Correction**: period ~1 year, amplitude ~0.186 degrees
   Argument: M (Sun's mean anomaly)

6. **Parallactic Inequality**: period ~29.53 days, amplitude ~0.125 degrees
   Argument: D (mean elongation)

7. **Reduction to Ecliptic**: period ~4.5 years, amplitude ~0.116 degrees
   Accounts for projection from inclined lunar orbital plane to ecliptic

## Precision and Validation

### Measured Precision

Precision is measured via 500-date random sampling against Swiss Ephemeris (`SE_OSCU_APOG`):

| Method | Mean Difference | Max Difference | RMS Difference |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **True Lilith** (LibEphemeris) | ~52 arcsec (~0.015 deg) | ~235 arcsec (~0.065 deg) | ~60 arcsec (~0.017 deg) |
| **Mean Lilith** | ~12 arcsec (~0.003 deg) | ~18 arcsec (~0.005 deg) | pyswisseph-compatible |
| Interpolated Apogee | ~1.1 deg | ~3.3 deg | Different algorithm |

For further precision benchmarks across all bodies, see [Precision Reference](../reference/precision.md).

### Lilith Method Selection Guide

| Use Case | Recommended Method | Precision vs Swiss Ephemeris |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Osculating lunar apogee | **True Lilith** | ~0.015 deg mean |
| Smooth, predictable motion | **Mean Lilith** | ~0.003 deg mean (compatible) |
| Physical apogee passages | Interpolated Apogee | ~1.1 deg (different algorithm) |
| Swiss Ephemeris compatibility (SE_OSCU_APOG) | **True Lilith** | Sub-arcminute |
| Swiss Ephemeris compatibility (SE_MEAN_APOG) | **Mean Lilith** | Sub-arcminute |

For applications requiring the osculating (instantaneous) lunar apogee, **True Lilith** (`calc_true_lilith`) is recommended. Its sub-arcminute precision makes it suitable for all practical astrological applications.

For smooth motion without 30-degree oscillations, **Mean Lilith** (`calc_mean_lilith`) provides predictable behavior and excellent Swiss Ephemeris compatibility (~0.003 deg mean difference).

## Comparison with Swiss Ephemeris

Both implementations use the same fundamental approach: **computing osculating orbital elements from the Moon's instantaneous state vectors**.

### Sources of Residual Differences

The small residual differences (~0.015 deg mean) between LibEphemeris and Swiss Ephemeris arise from:

1. **Different Ephemeris Sources**:
   - Swiss Ephemeris: Compressed JPL DE431 data with ~0.001" precision
   - LibEphemeris: JPL DE440 via Skyfield (slightly different interpolation)

2. **Perturbation Model Details**:
   Minor differences in how solar and planetary perturbations are incorporated. Swiss Ephemeris may use integrated analytical lunar theory internally, while LibEphemeris applies calibrated post-hoc corrections.

3. **Coordinate Transformation Differences**:
   Small differences in precession, nutation, and obliquity models.

### The Osculating Apogee Paradox

The +/-30 degree monthly oscillation of the osculating apogee is an artifact of the two-body approximation (see Brouwer & Clemence 1961, Ch. XI). This has important implications:

1. **No "Correct" Answer**: There is no single "correct" osculating apogee because the concept itself is a simplification that does not accurately represent lunar motion.

2. **Different Implementations Valid**: Both Swiss Ephemeris and LibEphemeris implementations are valid mathematical representations of the osculating apogee concept, even though they differ slightly.

3. **True Lilith is Model-Dependent**: When solar perturbations are significant (as they always are for the Moon), the "osculating apogee" concept is inherently ambiguous.

The osculating apogee is a mathematical construct with limited physical meaning. The "true" apogee in terms of actual lunar distance extremes only aligns with the osculating apogee twice per month.

## The Interpolated Apogee Alternative

The "interpolated" or "natural" apogee (`SE_INTP_APOG` in Swiss Ephemeris) smooths out the 30-degree oscillations by interpolating between actual lunar apogee passages. This results in:

- Oscillation amplitude: **+/- 5 degrees** (vs. +/- 30 degrees for osculating)
- More physically meaningful: represents actual variation of apogee passages
- Less dependent on two-body approximation artifacts

For details on the interpolated apogee implementation, see [Interpolated Apogee Methodology](interpolated-apogee.md).
