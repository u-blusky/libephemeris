# Lunar Apsides: Computational Methodology

## Background

The lunar apsides -- perigee (closest approach) and apogee (farthest point) --
are among the most computationally challenging quantities in positional
astronomy. The Moon's orbit is strongly perturbed by the Sun, causing the
instantaneous (osculating) perigee to oscillate by approximately +/-30 degrees
over a single anomalistic month.

For practical ephemeris use, this oscillation must be smoothed to produce an
"interpolated" or "natural" apsidal position that reflects the genuine
long-term motion of the apsidal line without the spurious short-period
volatility inherent in the two-body approximation.

The choice of smoothing methodology constitutes the most significant
computational difference between LibEphemeris and Swiss Ephemeris.

## Swiss Ephemeris Approach

Swiss Ephemeris computes the interpolated apsides using the analytical method
developed by S.L. Moshier, based on the ELP2000-82B lunar theory
(Chapront-Touze & Chapront, 1988).

This approach works within the analytical framework of the lunar theory itself:
the thousands of trigonometric terms in ELP2000-82B are classified by their
physical origin, and terms associated with the mean anomaly (the Moon's monthly
orbital cycle) are excluded. The remaining terms define the smoothed apsidal
position.

This produces a mathematically coherent result within its theoretical framework.
However, the output is constrained by the truncation level and fitting epoch of
the analytical theory (1988). The resulting curve can differ from the physical
geometry of the Earth-Moon system -- as represented by modern numerical
integrations -- by several degrees.

## LibEphemeris Approach

LibEphemeris constructs the interpolated apsides from the physical geometry of
the JPL DE440/DE441 numerical integrations:

1. **Passage identification.** All perigee passages (local Earth-Moon distance
   minima) are identified from JPL state vectors over a 1000-year calibration
   span (1500-2500 CE). At each passage, the Moon's ecliptic longitude is an
   unambiguous physical measurement of the perigee direction. Over 12,000
   passages are used.

2. **Spline interpolation.** A cubic spline is fitted through the passage
   longitudes (with angle unwrapping) to produce a smooth, continuous perigee
   longitude function at arbitrary times.

3. **Harmonic series calibration.** A 61-term trigonometric perturbation series,
   constructed from the standard Delaunay arguments (D, M, M', F), is fitted to
   the spline via least squares. Terms with amplitudes below 0.001 degrees are
   discarded.

4. **Residual correction.** A precomputed correction table (~15,000 entries)
   absorbs the remaining difference between the harmonic model and the JPL
   ground truth.

The result is a smooth apsidal curve anchored to the physical distance extrema
of the Moon as computed by modern numerical integration.

## Measured Discrepancy

The interpolated perigee (`SE_INTP_PERG`) in LibEphemeris differs from Swiss
Ephemeris by up to approximately 5 degrees. This is the largest single
discrepancy between the two libraries.

The difference arises from two distinct smoothing philosophies applied to the
same underlying phenomenon:

| Property                      | Swiss Ephemeris                 | LibEphemeris                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Ground truth                  | ELP2000-82B analytical theory   | JPL DE440/DE441 numerical integration   |
| Smoothing method              | Analytical term selection       | Physical passage interpolation          |
| Perigee oscillation amplitude | ~15 deg from mean               | ~25 deg from mean                       |
| Apogee oscillation amplitude  | ~5 deg from mean                | ~5 deg from mean                        |
| Date range                    | ~-5400 to +5400 CE              | 1550-2650 (DE440) / -13200 to +17191 (DE441) |

The interpolated apogee (`SE_INTP_APOG`) shows a smaller discrepancy (~0.36
degrees maximum), as both approaches produce similar results for the apogee
where perturbation amplitudes are smaller.

## Rationale

LibEphemeris adopts JPL numerical integrations as the primary reference for
orbital geometry. The DE440/DE441 ephemerides incorporate lunar laser ranging
data accurate to approximately 1 milliarcsecond and represent the current
standard for planetary and lunar ephemeris computation (Park et al., 2021).

The ELP2000-82B theory, while a significant achievement of 20th-century
celestial mechanics, is a truncated analytical approximation fitted to an
earlier generation of observations. Where the analytical smoothing and the
physical passage interpolation disagree, the JPL-grounded approach more closely
represents the actual state of the Earth-Moon system.

This choice prioritises physical accuracy over backward compatibility with
the analytical framework.
