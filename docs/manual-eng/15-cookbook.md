# Chapter 15 — Cookbook: Practical Calculations from A to Z

## What You Will Learn

This chapter is a collection of **complete recipes**, ready to copy and paste. Each recipe solves a common practical problem: from the birth chart to transits, from retrogrades to eclipses. There is no theory to read — just working code with its output.

## Recipe 1 — Complete Birth Chart

**Problem**: Given the date, time, and place of birth, calculate all planetary positions and houses.

**What it is used for**: The birth chart is the foundation of any astrological analysis. This code produces the "photograph of the sky" at the moment of birth: the positions of the planets in the signs, the twelve houses, and the main angles (Ascendant and Midheaven). From here all interpretations begin — from personality (Sun position) to emotions (Moon), to the way of communicating (Mercury), up to the structure of life areas (houses). A concrete application: an astrological software that automatically generates the birth chart starting from the user's personal data.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

# Rome, April 8, 2024, 14:30 UT
jd = ephem.julday(2024, 4, 8, 14.5)

signs = ["Ari", "Tau", "Gem", "Cnc", "Leo", "Vir",
         "Lib", "Sco", "Sgr", "Cap", "Aqr", "Psc"]

def zodiac_format(lon):
    sign_idx = int(lon / 30)
    degrees = lon % 30
    d, m, s, sf, si = ephem.split_deg(degrees, 0)
    return f'{d:2d}° {m:02d}\' {s:02d}" {signs[sign_idx]}'

bodies = [
    (ephem.SE_SUN,       "Sun"),
    (ephem.SE_MOON,      "Moon"),
    (ephem.SE_MERCURY,   "Mercury"),
    (ephem.SE_VENUS,     "Venus"),
    (ephem.SE_MARS,      "Mars"),

    (ephem.SE_URANUS,    "Uranus"),
    (ephem.SE_NEPTUNE,   "Neptune"),
    (ephem.SE_PLUTO,     "Pluto"),
    (ephem.SE_MEAN_NODE, "North Node"),
    (ephem.SE_CHIRON,    "Chiron"),
]

print("--- Birth Chart: Rome, April 8, 2024, 14:30 ---")
print()
for body_id, name in bodies:
    pos, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd, body_id, ephem.SEFLG_SPEED)
    retro = " R" if pos[3] < 0 else ""
    print(f"{name:11s}  {zodiac_format(pos[0])}{retro}")

# Placidus Houses — Rome (lat 41.9, lon 12.5)
cusps, ascmc = ephem.houses(jd, 41.9, 12.5, ord("P"))
print()
print(f"Ascendant:   {zodiac_format(ascmc[0])}")
print(f"Midheaven:   {zodiac_format(ascmc[1])}")
print()
for i in range(12):
    print(f"House {i+1:2d}:    {zodiac_format(cusps[i])}")
```

## Recipe 2 — Daily Transits

**Problem**: Given a birth chart, find which transiting planets are in aspect with natal planets today.

**What it is used for**: Transits are the most widespread method of astrological forecasting. The principle is simple: "today's" planets form significant angles (conjunction, square, trine...) with the positions of the birth chart, activating the themes represented by those planets. For example, Saturn squaring the natal Sun indicates a period of challenges and restructuring of one's identity — typically lasting a few weeks. A concrete application: an app that every morning shows the user the active transits on their chart, along with the orb (how close it is to the exact aspect).

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

# Natal positions: born March 15, 1990, 10:00 UT
jd_natal = ephem.julday(1990, 3, 15, 10.0)
# Transit date: April 8, 2024
jd_transit = ephem.julday(2024, 4, 8, 12.0)

planets = [
    (ephem.SE_SUN, "Sun"), (ephem.SE_MOON, "Moon"),
    (ephem.SE_MERCURY, "Mercury"), (ephem.SE_VENUS, "Venus"),
    (ephem.SE_MARS, "Mars"), (ephem.SE_JUPITER, "Jupiter"),
    (ephem.SE_SATURN, "Saturn"),
]

# Calculate natal and transit positions
natal_pos = {}
for body_id, name in planets:
    pos, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd_natal, body_id, 0)
    natal_pos[name] = pos[0]

transit_pos = {}
for body_id, name in planets:
    pos, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd_transit, body_id, 0)
    transit_pos[name] = pos[0]

# Define aspects and orbs
aspects = {0: "Conjunction", 60: "Sextile", 90: "Square",
           120: "Trine", 180: "Opposition"}
orbs = {0: 8, 60: 6, 90: 7, 120: 7, 180: 8}

print("--- Transits of April 8, 2024, on March 15, 1990 chart ---")
print()
for t_name, t_lon in transit_pos.items():
    for n_name, n_lon in natal_pos.items():
        diff = abs(ephem.difdeg2n(t_lon, n_lon))
        for asp_deg, asp_name in aspects.items():
            orb = abs(diff - asp_deg)
            if orb <= orbs[asp_deg]:
                print(f"{t_name:10s} {asp_name:14s} {n_name:10s}"
                      f"  (orb: {orb:.1f}°)")
                break
```

```

## Recipe 3 — Sun Ingresses into Signs

**Problem**: Find the exact date and time when the Sun enters each zodiac sign during the year.

**What it is used for**: The Sun's ingresses into the signs mark the changes of season (Aries = spring equinox, Cancer = summer solstice, etc.) and are fundamental dates in mundane astrology. The chart erected for the moment of the Aries ingress (the so-called "chart of the year") is used to make predictions for the entire year for a nation. In astronomy, knowing the exact moment of the equinox is useful for calibrating sundials and almanacs. A concrete application: an astrological calendar that automatically shows the sign change dates for any given year.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

jd = ephem.julday(2024, 1, 1, 0.0)

signs = ["Aries", "Taurus", "Gemini", "Cancer",
         "Leo", "Virgo", "Libra", "Scorpio",
         "Sagittarius", "Capricorn", "Aquarius", "Pisces"]

print("--- Sun Ingresses into Signs (2024) ---")
print()
for i in range(12):
    target = i * 30.0
    jd_ingress = ephem.solcross_ut(target, jd)
    year, month, day, hour = ephem.revjul(jd_ingress)
    hours = int(hour)
    minutes = int((hour - hours) * 60)
    print(f"{signs[i]:12s}  {day:2d}/{month:02d}/{year}"
          f"  {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d} UT")
    jd = jd_ingress + 1
```

```
--- Sun Ingresses into Signs (2024) ---

Aries         20/03/2024  03:06 UT
Taurus        19/04/2024  13:59 UT
Gemini        20/05/2024  12:59 UT
Cancer        20/06/2024  20:50 UT
Leo           22/07/2024  07:44 UT
Virgo         22/08/2024  14:55 UT

Aquarius      19/01/2025  20:00 UT
Pisces        18/02/2025  10:06 UT
```

## Recipe 4 — Mercury Retrograde

**Problem**: Find all the retrograde and direct stations of Mercury in the year, and check if it is retrograde on a specific date.

**What it is used for**: Mercury retrograde is one of the most popular — and feared — astrological events. When Mercury is retrograde (meaning it appears to move backward as seen from Earth), astrological tradition associates the period with misunderstandings in communication, problems with contracts and technology, and travel delays. In practice, many people avoid signing contracts or buying electronics during these periods. This code finds the exact start (retrograde station) and end (direct station) dates of each retrograde, along with the precise zodiacal degree. A concrete application: a digital planner that automatically highlights Mercury retrograde periods.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem
from libephemeris.crossing import swe_find_station_ut, is_retrograde

jd = ephem.julday(2024, 1, 1, 0.0)
jd_end = ephem.julday(2025, 1, 1, 0.0)

signs = ["Ari", "Tau", "Gem", "Cnc", "Leo", "Vir",
         "Lib", "Sco", "Sgr", "Cap", "Aqr", "Psc"]

print("--- Mercury Retrogrades in 2024 ---")
print()
while jd < jd_end:
    jd_station, type_ = swe_find_station_ut(
        ephem.SE_MERCURY, jd, "any"
    )
    if jd_station >= jd_end:
        break
    year, month, day, hour = ephem.revjul(jd_station)
    hours = int(hour)
    minutes = int((hour - hours) * 60)
    pos, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd_station, ephem.SE_MERCURY, 0)
    sign = signs[int(pos[0] / 30)]
    degrees = pos[0] % 30
    label = ("Retrograde Station" if type_ == "SR"
             else "Direct Station    ")
    print(f"{label}  {day:2d}/{month:02d}/{year}"
          f"  {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d} UT  at {degrees:5.1f}° {sign}")
    jd = jd_station + 1

# Point-in-time check
print()
retro = is_retrograde(ephem.SE_MERCURY,
                      ephem.julday(2024, 4, 8, 12.0))
print(f"Is Mercury retrograde on 8/4/2024? {retro}")
```

```
--- Mercury Retrogrades in 2024 ---

## Recipe 5 — New Moon and Full Moon

**Problem**: Find all the New and Full Moons of the year with date, time, and zodiac sign.

**What it is used for**: Lunar phases have set the rhythm of daily life for millennia. The New Moon (Sun-Moon conjunction) is traditionally the time to sow new projects, while the Full Moon (opposition) is the time of harvest and maximum energy — but also of emotional tension. In biodynamic agriculture, sowing still follows the lunar calendar. In astrology, the sign in which the New Moon falls indicates the "theme" of the month: a New Moon in Aries invites courageous action, one in Pisces to let go. A concrete application: a lunar calendar that shows the phases with their signs, useful for gardeners, fishermen, or anyone who follows lunar rhythms.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

jd = ephem.julday(2024, 1, 1, 0.0)
jd_end = ephem.julday(2025, 1, 1, 0.0)

signs = ["Ari", "Tau", "Gem", "Cnc", "Leo", "Vir",
         "Lib", "Sco", "Sgr", "Cap", "Aqr", "Psc"]

print("--- New and Full Moons in 2024 ---")
print()
while jd < jd_end:
    # Sun's current longitude
    pos_sun, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd, ephem.SE_SUN, 0)
    lon_sun = pos_sun[0]

    # New Moon: Moon conjuncts the Sun
    jd_new = ephem.mooncross_ut(lon_sun, jd)
    if jd_new < jd_end:
        year, month, day, hour = ephem.revjul(jd_new)
        hours = int(hour)
        minutes = int((hour - hours) * 60)
        pos_moon, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd_new, ephem.SE_MOON, 0)
        sign = signs[int(pos_moon[0] / 30)]
        degrees = pos_moon[0] % 30
        print(f"New Moon    {day:2d}/{month:02d}/{year}"
              f"  {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d} UT"
              f"  in {degrees:5.1f}° {sign}")

    # Full Moon: Moon opposite the Sun (180°)
    target_full = (lon_sun + 180.0) % 360.0
    jd_full = ephem.mooncross_ut(target_full, jd)
    if jd_full < jd_end and jd_full > jd:
        year, month, day, hour = ephem.revjul(jd_full)
        hours = int(hour)
        minutes = int((hour - hours) * 60)
        pos_moon, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd_full, ephem.SE_MOON, 0)
        sign = signs[int(pos_moon[0] / 30)]
        degrees = pos_moon[0] % 30
        print(f"Full Moon   {day:2d}/{month:02d}/{year}"
              f"  {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d} UT"
              f"  in {degrees:5.1f}° {sign}")

    print()
    # Advance by ~20 days to find the next pair
    jd = min(jd_new, jd_full) + 20
    if jd >= jd_end:
        break
```

## Recipe 6 — Next Solar Eclipse from My City

**Problem**: Find the next solar eclipses visible from a specific location, with contact times and magnitude.

**What it is used for**: Solar eclipses are spectacular but rare events for any given location — decades can pass between one total eclipse and the next. Knowing in advance when and how an eclipse will be visible from your city is essential for organizing observations (solar filters, travel, vacations). The magnitude indicates how much of the solar disk will be covered: 1.0 = total, 0.5 = half, 0.01 = barely perceptible. A concrete application: a website that, given the user's location, shows the next visible eclipse with a map of the contacts.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

jd = ephem.julday(2024, 1, 1, 0.0)
lat, lon, alt = 41.9, 12.5, 0.0  # Rome

print("--- Next Solar Eclipses Visible from Rome ---")
print()
found = 0
for _ in range(20):  # search up to 20 eclipses ahead
    ecl_type, times, attr = ephem.sol_eclipse_when_loc(
        jd, lat, lon, alt
    )
    if ecl_type > 0 and attr[0] > 0.01:
        jd_max = times[0]
        year, month, day, hour = ephem.revjul(jd_max)
        hours = int(hour)
        minutes = int((hour - hours) * 60)

        type_ = "Partial"
        if ecl_type & 4: type_ = "Annular"
        if ecl_type & 1: type_ = "Total"

        print(f"{type_:10s}  {day:2d}/{month:02d}/{year}"
              f"  {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d} UT"
              f"  magnitude: {attr[0]:.3f}")

        # Start and end times
        if times[1] > 0:
            _, _, _, h = ephem.revjul(times[1])
            print(f"  Start:   {int(h):02d}:"
                  f"{int((h - int(h)) * 60):02d} UT")
        if times[4] > 0:
            _, _, _, h = ephem.revjul(times[4])
            print(f"  End:     {int(h):02d}:"
                  f"{int((h - int(h)) * 60):02d} UT")
        print()
        found += 1
        if found >= 3:
            break

    jd = times[0] + 30 if times[0] > 0 else jd + 180
```

## Recipe 7 — Sidereal Chart (Vedic)

**Problem**: Calculate planetary positions in the sidereal zodiac with Lahiri ayanamsha, including the Nakshatras.

**What it is used for**: Vedic astrology (Jyotish) uses the sidereal zodiac instead of the tropical one — positions are shifted by about 24° compared to Western ones. Nakshatras are 27 "lunar mansions" of 13°20' each, further divided into 4 Padas; the position of the Moon in the Nakshatra is fundamental for calculating the Dashas (planetary periods that govern life). For example, someone with the Moon in the Ashwini Nakshatra will live their first period under Ketu (7 years), then under Venus (20 years), etc. A concrete application: a Jyotish software that generates the sidereal chart, the Nakshatras, and the calculation of the Dashas.

## Recipe 8 — Visibility of Planets Tonight

**Problem**: For every planet visible to the naked eye, calculate its altitude, direction, magnitude, and elongation from the Sun one hour after sunset.

**What it is used for**: Knowing which planets are visible tonight is the most practical question for stargazers. The altitude above the horizon tells whether the planet is high enough to be seen (above buildings and trees); the elongation from the Sun tells whether it is immersed in the twilight glare; the magnitude tells how bright it is (under 6 = visible to the naked eye, under 0 = very bright). For example, Jupiter at magnitude -2.0 and an altitude of 15° to the east is unmistakable — it is the "bright point" that many mistake for an airplane. A concrete application: an app for amateur astronomers that shows "what's in the sky tonight" with direction and brightness.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

# Rome, April 8, 2024
lat, lon = 41.9, 12.5
jd_noon = ephem.julday(2024, 4, 8, 12.0)

# Find the exact sunset time
jd_set, _ = ephem.rise_trans(
    jd_noon, ephem.SE_SUN, lat, lon, rsmi=2
)
year, month, day, hour = ephem.revjul(jd_set)
hours_s = int(hour)
minutes_s = int((hour - hours_s) * 60)
print(f"Sunset: {hours_s:02d}:{minutes_s:02d} UT")
print()

# One hour after sunset
jd_evening = jd_set + 1.0 / 24.0
ephem.set_topo(lon, lat, 0)

    (ephem.SE_MARS,    "Mars"),
    (ephem.SE_JUPITER, "Jupiter"),
    (ephem.SE_SATURN,  "Saturn"),
]

dirs = ["N", "NE", "E", "SE", "S", "SW", "W", "NW"]

print("--- Planet Visibility (Rome, 8/4/2024) ---")
print()
for body_id, name in planets:
    pos, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd_evening, body_id, 0)

    # Altitude and azimuth
    az, alt_t, alt_app = ephem.azalt(
        jd_evening, 0, (lon, lat, 0),
        1013.25, 15.0, (pos[0], pos[1], pos[2])
    )

    # Elongation from the Sun
    elong = abs(ephem.difdeg2n(pos[0], pos_sun[0]))

    # Apparent magnitude
    pheno, _ = ephem.swe_pheno_ut(jd_evening, body_id, 0)
    mag = pheno[4]

    # Cardinal direction
    dir_idx = int((az + 22.5) / 45) % 8
    direction = dirs[dir_idx]

    visible = ("VISIBLE" if alt_app > 5 and elong > 15
               else "not visible")
    print(f"{name:10s}  alt: {alt_app:5.1f}°"
          f"  az: {az:5.1f}° ({direction:2s})"
          f"  mag: {mag:+.1f}"
          f"  elong: {elong:5.1f}°"
          f"  {visible}")
```

```
Sunset: 17:43 UT

--- Planet Visibility (Rome, 8/4/2024) ---

Mercury     alt:  -5.5°  az: 111.8° (E )  mag: +4.8  elong:   5.4°  not visible
Venus       alt: -25.8°  az: 116.4° (SE)  mag: -3.9  elong:  15.0°  not visible

```

> On this evening in April 2024, only Jupiter is visible — low in the east, very bright (mag -2.0). The other planets are below the horizon or too close to the Sun.

## Recipe 9 — Aspects Between Planets

**Problem**: Calculate the angular distance between all planets and identify the active aspects (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition).

**What it is used for**: Aspects are the angular relationships between planets — the fundamental language of astrology. A conjunction (0°) merges the energies of the two planets; a trine (120°) harmonizes them; a square (90°) puts them in tension. For example, Sun conjunct Moon (as on April 8, 2024) indicates a New Moon — a time of emotional reset and new beginnings. Mars conjunct Saturn indicates a phase of frustration but also of constructive discipline. Knowing whether an aspect is "applying" (forming) or "separating" (dissolving) changes the interpretation: an applying aspect is more intense. A concrete application: an automatic interpretation module that reads the aspects and generates a descriptive text.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

jd = ephem.julday(2024, 4, 8, 12.0)

planets = [
    (ephem.SE_SUN,     "Sun"),
    (ephem.SE_MOON,    "Moon"),
    (ephem.SE_MERCURY, "Mercury"),
    (ephem.SE_VENUS,   "Venus"),
    (ephem.SE_MARS,    "Mars"),
    (ephem.SE_JUPITER, "Jupiter"),
    (ephem.SE_SATURN,  "Saturn"),
]

# Calculate positions and velocities
positions = {}
for body_id, name in planets:
    pos, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd, body_id, ephem.SEFLG_SPEED)
    positions[name] = (pos[0], pos[3])  # longitude, velocity

aspects = {0: "Conjunction", 60: "Sextile",
           90: "Square", 120: "Trine",
           180: "Opposition"}
max_orbs = {0: 8, 60: 5, 90: 6, 120: 6, 180: 8}

print("--- Aspects Between Planets (April 8, 2024) ---")
print()
names = list(positions.keys())
for i in range(len(names)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(names)):
        n1, n2 = names[i], names[j]
        lon1, vel1 = positions[n1]
        lon2, vel2 = positions[n2]
        diff = abs(ephem.difdeg2n(lon1, lon2))

        for asp_deg, asp_name in aspects.items():
            orb = abs(diff - asp_deg)
            if orb <= max_orbs[asp_deg]:
                print(f"{n1:10s} {asp_name:14s} {n2:10s}"
                      f"  orb: {orb:4.1f}°")
                break
```

```

## Recipe 10 — Solar Return

**Problem**: Find the exact moment when the Sun returns to the same longitude as at birth, and calculate the chart for that instant.

**What it is used for**: The solar return is one of the most widely used predictive techniques in astrology. Every year, the Sun returns exactly to the degree it was at the moment of birth — that precise instant generates a "chart of the year" that is superimposed on the birth chart. The Ascendant of the solar return indicates the "tone" of the year: for example, an Ascendant in Virgo suggests a year dedicated to work, organization, and health. The position of the Moon in the return indicates the emotional climate of the next twelve months. A concrete application: a software that automatically generates the solar return for every birthday and compares it with the birth chart.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

# Born March 15, 1990, 10:00 UT, Rome
jd_natal = ephem.julday(1990, 3, 15, 10.0)
pos_natal, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd_natal, ephem.SE_SUN, 0)
lon_natal = pos_natal[0]

# Find the solar return for 2024
jd_search = ephem.julday(2024, 3, 1, 0.0)
jd_return = ephem.solcross_ut(lon_natal, jd_search)

year, month, day, hour = ephem.revjul(jd_return)
hours = int(hour)
minutes = int((hour - hours) * 60)
seconds = int(((hour - hours) * 60 - minutes) * 60)

signs = ["Ari", "Tau", "Gem", "Cnc", "Leo", "Vir",
         "Lib", "Sco", "Sgr", "Cap", "Aqr", "Psc"]

print("--- Solar Return 2024 ---")
print()
print(f"Natal Sun: {lon_natal:.6f}°")
print(f"Return:    {day:2d}/{month:02d}/{year}"
      f"  {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d} UT")
print()

bodies = [
    (ephem.SE_SUN,     "Sun"),
    (ephem.SE_MOON,    "Moon"),
    (ephem.SE_MERCURY, "Mercury"),
    (ephem.SE_VENUS,   "Venus"),
    (ephem.SE_MARS,    "Mars"),
    (ephem.SE_JUPITER, "Jupiter"),
    (ephem.SE_SATURN,  "Saturn"),
]

for body_id, name in bodies:
    pos, _ = ephem.calc_ut(jd_return, body_id, 0)
    sign = signs[int(pos[0] / 30)]
    degrees = pos[0] % 30
    d, m, s, sf, si = ephem.split_deg(degrees, 0)
    print(f"{name:10s}  {d:2d}° {m:02d}'  {sign}")

# Placidus Houses for Rome
cusps, ascmc = ephem.houses(
    jd_return, 41.9, 12.5, ord("P")
)
print()
print(f"SR Ascendant:   {ascmc[0]:.2f}°"
      f" ({signs[int(ascmc[0] / 30)]})")
print(f"SR Midheaven:   {ascmc[1]:.2f}°"
      f" ({signs[int(ascmc[1] / 30)]})")
```

```

## Recipe 11 — Planetary Hours

**Problem**: Calculate the planetary hours of the day, dividing the time between sunrise and sunset into 12 parts and assigning a planet to each according to the Chaldean sequence.

**What it is used for**: Planetary hours are one of the oldest systems of time organization, dating back to Babylon. The idea is that every hour of the day is "ruled" by a planet, following the Chaldean sequence (Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon, and then it repeats). The first diurnal hour is ruled by the planet of the day: Monday = Moon, Tuesday = Mars, etc. A planetary hour does not last 60 minutes — it lasts 1/12 of the daylight period (in summer, diurnal hours are longer). In horary astrology and ceremonial magic, one chooses the hour of the appropriate planet to start an activity: the hour of Venus for matters of love, the hour of Mercury to sign contracts, the hour of Jupiter for financial affairs. A concrete application: an app that shows in real-time which planetary hour is currently active, with a countdown to the next one.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

lat, lon = 41.9, 12.5  # Rome
jd_noon = ephem.julday(2024, 4, 8, 12.0)

# Find sunrise, sunset, and next sunrise
jd_rise, _ = ephem.rise_trans(
    jd_noon - 0.5, ephem.SE_SUN, lat, lon, rsmi=1
)
jd_set, _ = ephem.rise_trans(
    jd_noon, ephem.SE_SUN, lat, lon, rsmi=2
)
jd_rise_tmrw, _ = ephem.rise_trans(
    jd_set, ephem.SE_SUN, lat, lon, rsmi=1
)

_, _, _, h_rise = ephem.revjul(jd_rise)
_, _, _, h_set = ephem.revjul(jd_set)
print(f"Sunrise:  {int(h_rise):02d}:"
      f"{int((h_rise - int(h_rise)) * 60):02d} UT")
print(f"Sunset:   {int(h_set):02d}:"
      f"{int((h_set - int(h_set)) * 60):02d} UT")

# Duration of a planetary hour
day_hour = (jd_set - jd_rise) / 12
night_hour = (jd_rise_tmrw - jd_set) / 12
print(f"Day hour duration:   {day_hour * 24 * 60:.1f} min")
print(f"Night hour duration: {night_hour * 24 * 60:.1f} min")
print()

## Recipe 12 — Printable Monthly Ephemeris

**Problem**: Generate a table with the position of all planets for each day of the month, in zodiacal format.

**What it is used for**: The ephemeris is the astrologer's working tool — a table showing "where the planets are" every day at noon. Before computers, astrologers consulted voluminous ephemeris books (such as the famous *Raphael's Ephemeris*) to calculate charts manually. Even today, a compact table is useful to get an overview of the month: you can see at a glance when a planet changes sign, when the Moon quickly transits through the zodiac, and when Mercury slows down before its retrograde. A concrete application: a generator of customized PDF ephemerides for any given year.

```python
import libephemeris as ephem

signs = ["Ari", "Tau", "Gem", "Cnc", "Leo", "Vir",
         "Lib", "Sco", "Sgr", "Cap", "Aqr", "Psc"]

def fmt(lon):

    d = lon % 30
    return f"{d:5.1f}{s}"

## Summary

This chapter has presented 12 complete recipes for the most common astronomical and astrological calculations:

- **Recipe 1** — Complete birth chart with planets, houses, and angles
- **Recipe 2** — Daily transits on a birth chart
- **Recipe 3** — Sun ingresses into the 12 signs (equinoxes and solstices)
- **Recipe 4** — Mercury retrogrades (stations and verification)
- **Recipe 5** — New and Full Moons of the year
- **Recipe 6** — Next solar eclipses visible from a city
- **Recipe 7** — Vedic sidereal chart with Nakshatras and Padas
- **Recipe 8** — Visibility of planets tonight (altitude, magnitude, direction)
- **Recipe 9** — Aspects between planets with orb
- **Recipe 10** — Solar Return
- **Recipe 11** — Planetary hours (Chaldean sequence)
- **Recipe 12** — Printable monthly ephemeris

Each recipe is self-contained and ready to use: just copy the code, modify the date and coordinates, and run it.

## Functions Used in the Recipes

- `julday(y, m, d, h)` / `revjul(jd)` — date ↔ Julian Day conversion
- `calc_ut(jd, body, flag)` — position of a celestial body
- `houses(jd, lat, lon, hsys)` — house cusps and angles
- `split_deg(deg, flag)` — splits decimal degrees into °, ', "
- `difdeg2n(p1, p2)` — normalized angular difference [-180, 180]
- `solcross_ut(x, jd)` — Sun crossing at a longitude
- `mooncross_ut(x, jd)` — Moon crossing at a longitude
- `swe_find_station_ut(body, jd, type)` — next retrograde/direct station (from `libephemeris.crossing`)
- `is_retrograde(body, jd)` — retrograde verification (from `libephemeris.crossing`)
- `sol_eclipse_when_loc(jd, lat, lon, alt)` — local solar eclipse
- `swe_set_sid_mode(mode)` / `swe_get_ayanamsa_ut(jd)` — sidereal zodiac
- `rise_trans(jd, body, lat, lon, rsmi=...)` — sunrise and sunset
- `azalt(jd, flag, geopos, press, temp, xin)` — horizontal coordinates
- `swe_pheno_ut(jd, body, flag)` — phenomena (magnitude, phase, elongation)
- `set_topo(lon, lat, alt)` — observer's position
