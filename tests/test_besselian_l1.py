"""
Tests for calc_besselian_l1 function in libephemeris.

Tests the Besselian l1 (penumbral shadow radius) calculation for solar eclipses.

The Besselian element l1 is the radius of the penumbral shadow cone where it
intersects the fundamental plane, measured in Earth equatorial radii. This
determines the extent of the partial eclipse zone on Earth.
