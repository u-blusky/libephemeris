"""
Tests for UTC leap second handling in UTC to UT1 conversion.

This module verifies that the libephemeris time conversion functions correctly
handle leap seconds when converting between UTC, UT1, TAI, and TT time scales.

Leap seconds are inserted by IERS to keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of UT1.
The relationship between time scales is:
    - TAI (International Atomic Time): Continuous atomic time
    - UTC = TAI - leap_seconds (UTC is adjusted by leap seconds)
    - TT = TAI + 32.184 seconds (Terrestrial Time)
    - UT1 = UTC + (UT1-UTC), where |UT1-UTC| < 0.9 seconds

Key leap second dates tested:
    - 1972-01-01: TAI-UTC = 10 seconds (first leap second system)
    - 2017-01-01: TAI-UTC = 37 seconds (most recent as of 2024)
