"""
Tests for calc_besselian_mu function in libephemeris.

Tests the Besselian mu (Greenwich hour angle) calculation for solar eclipses.

The Besselian element mu is the Greenwich hour angle of the shadow axis,
measured in degrees. It represents the angle between the Greenwich meridian
and the hour circle containing the shadow axis, measured westward from
Greenwich along the celestial equator.
