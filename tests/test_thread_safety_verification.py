"""
Advanced thread safety verification tests for EphemerisContext.

This module provides rigorous tests that verify EphemerisContext provides true
thread safety for multi-threaded applications. These tests go beyond basic
concurrent access testing to verify:

1. Lock correctness - The context swap lock properly serializes access
2. No deadlocks - High contention doesn't cause deadlocks
3. State isolation - Each context's state is truly isolated
4. Result consistency - Concurrent calculations produce correct results
5. Memory visibility - State changes are visible across threads
6. Stress resilience - Thread safety holds under extreme load

These tests are designed to catch race conditions that may only manifest
under specific timing conditions.
