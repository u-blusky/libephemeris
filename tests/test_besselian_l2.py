"""
Tests for calc_besselian_l2 function in libephemeris.

Tests the Besselian l2 (umbral/antumbral shadow radius) calculation for solar eclipses.

The Besselian element l2 is the radius of the umbral (or antumbral) shadow cone where it
intersects the fundamental plane, measured in Earth equatorial radii. This determines
whether a total or annular eclipse is possible:
- l2 > 0: Umbral shadow (total eclipse possible)
- l2 < 0: Antumbral shadow (annular eclipse)
