"""
Tests for parallactic inequality correction in the True Lilith (osculating lunar apogee) calculation.

The Parallactic Inequality (also called the parallactic equation) is a perturbation
of lunar motion caused by the finite distance between the Earth and Moon. It arises
from the fact that the Moon's parallax varies with its distance from Earth, which
in turn depends on the solar perturbations.

Key characteristics:
- Period: ~29.53 days (synodic month)
- Amplitude: ~0.125 degrees
- Argument: D (mean elongation of Moon from Sun)
- Cause: variation in Moon's horizontal parallax due to distance changes

The parallactic inequality correction term in True Lilith is: 0.125 * sin(D)
