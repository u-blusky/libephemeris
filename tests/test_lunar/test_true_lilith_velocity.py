"""
Tests for True Lilith (osculating lunar apogee) velocity calculation.

Validates that velocity (SEFLG_SPEED) is calculated correctly via numerical
differentiation for True Lilith.

True Lilith (osculating apogee) can move rapidly because the osculating orbital
elements change quickly due to solar perturbations. This makes velocity
calculation particularly important for accurate ephemeris generation.

Velocity precision characteristics:
- True Lilith velocity: The osculating apogee velocity varies significantly
  due to the rapidly changing osculating orbital elements.
- Expected range: approximately -1.0 to +1.0 degrees/day with typical values
  around 0.1-0.5 degrees/day.

The True Lilith position calculation has known differences from pyswisseph
(up to 5-7 degrees in some cases - see test_true_lilith_precision.py).
Since velocity is derived via numerical differentiation, velocity accuracy
is inherently bounded by position accuracy.
