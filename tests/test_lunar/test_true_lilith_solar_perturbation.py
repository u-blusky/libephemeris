"""
Tests for solar gravitational perturbation on the eccentricity vector in True Lilith.

The True Lilith calculation applies a three-body correction to the eccentricity
vector to account for the Sun's gravitational influence on the lunar orbit.
This perturbation rotates the eccentricity vector based on the angle between
the apsidal line and the Sun's direction, capturing the quadrupole nature of
solar tidal forces.

Physical Background:
- The Sun's tidal force creates a quadrupole field at the Earth
- This field perturbs the lunar eccentricity vector direction
- The effect depends on sin(2*theta) where theta is the angle between
  the eccentricity vector and the solar direction in the orbital plane
- The amplitude is approximately 0.01148 in eccentricity units
- This corresponds to the evection perturbation (~1.274 degrees in longitude)
