"""
Tests for the interpolated lunar perigee (SE_INTP_PERG).

The interpolated perigee is a smoothed version of the osculating perigee that
removes spurious short-period oscillations by polynomial regression through
successive osculating perigee positions.

Algorithm Design (based on Swiss Ephemeris research):
- Sample osculating perigee (apogee + 180°) at 7 points spanning ~14 days
- Use polynomial regression (degree 2) for smooth, continuous curves
- The polynomial ensures continuous first derivatives (velocity)

Key facts about the "natural" perigee (from Swiss Ephemeris documentation):
- Perigee oscillates ~25° from mean position (vs. apogee ~5°)
- Apogee and perigee are not exactly opposite at all times
- The interpolation is done directly on perigee values for consistency

These tests verify:
1. Basic functionality and API compatibility
2. Return value format and ranges
3. Direct interpolation on perigee values (not derived from apogee)
4. Velocity calculations
5. Relationship between interpolated perigee and osculating perigee
6. Proper smoothing of oscillations
