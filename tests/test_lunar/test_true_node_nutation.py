Tests for IAU 2000A nutation correction in True Lunar Node calculations.

This module validates that the True Node calculation correctly applies
nutation to rotate from the mean ecliptic to the true ecliptic of date.

The nutation correction adds up to ~9" (0.0025 degrees) oscillation
with an 18.6-year dominant period matching the lunar node precession.
