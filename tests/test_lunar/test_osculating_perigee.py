"""
Tests for the osculating lunar perigee calculation.

The osculating perigee is computed directly from the eccentricity vector,
which naturally points toward perigee. This is different from the approach
of computing apogee and adding 180 degrees, which is incorrect because
apogee and perigee are NOT exactly opposite — they can deviate by up to
28 degrees depending on Sun-Moon geometry (Chapront-Touzé & Chapront 1988;
Meeus, Astronomical Algorithms ch. 47).

These tests verify:
1. Basic functionality of calc_osculating_perigee
2. The perigee is computed independently (not just apogee + 180)
3. The relationship between apogee and perigee (approximately opposite)
4. Consistency of interpolated perigee results
