Tests for the ELP2000-82B apogee perturbation series implementation.

This module tests the _calc_elp2000_apogee_perturbations() function which
implements the analytical perturbation series for the lunar apsidal line.

The perturbation series models the ~5° oscillations of the apogee around its
mean position, following the ELP2000-82B lunar theory by Chapront-Touze & Chapront.

Key tests:
1. Perturbation returns reasonable values (within expected range)
2. Perturbation varies smoothly over time (no discontinuities)
3. Dominant terms have expected periods and amplitudes
4. Integration with calc_interpolated_apogee() produces improved results
