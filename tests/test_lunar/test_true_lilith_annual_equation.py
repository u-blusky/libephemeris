"""
Tests for annual equation correction in the True Lilith (osculating lunar apogee) calculation.

The Annual Equation is a perturbation of lunar motion caused by the variation in
the Earth-Sun distance due to Earth's orbital eccentricity. When Earth is closer
to the Sun (perihelion), the solar gravitational perturbation on the Moon is
stronger, affecting both the Moon's longitude and the position of the lunar apogee.

Key characteristics:
- Period: ~365.25 days (anomalistic year)
- Amplitude: ~0.186 degrees
- Argument: M (Sun's mean anomaly)
- Cause: variation in solar gravitational perturbation due to Earth's elliptical orbit

The annual equation correction term in True Lilith is: 0.1856 * sin(M)
