"""
Tests for the interpolated lunar apogee (SE_INTP_APOG) and perigee (SE_INTP_PERG).

The interpolated apogee is a smoothed version of the osculating apogee that
removes spurious short-period oscillations by cubic spline interpolation through
successive osculating apogee positions.

Algorithm Design (based on Swiss Ephemeris research):
- Sample osculating apogee at 7 points spanning ~14 days (half synodic month)
- Use natural cubic spline interpolation for smooth, continuous curves
- The spline ensures continuous first derivatives (velocity)

Key facts about the "natural" apogee (from Swiss Ephemeris documentation):
- Apogee oscillates ~5° from mean position (vs. perigee ~25°)
- Apogee and perigee are not exactly opposite at all times
- Swiss Ephemeris uses an analytical method from Moshier's lunar theory

These tests verify:
1. Basic functionality and API compatibility
2. Return value format and ranges
3. Relationship between interpolated and osculating apogee
4. Velocity calculations
5. Perigee as opposite of apogee
6. Cubic spline interpolation correctness
7. Proper smoothing of oscillations
