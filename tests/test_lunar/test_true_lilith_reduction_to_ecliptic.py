"""
Tests for reduction to ecliptic correction in the True Lilith (osculating lunar apogee) calculation.

The Reduction to Ecliptic is a geometric correction that accounts for the projection
of the lunar apogee position from the inclined lunar orbital plane onto the ecliptic
plane. The Moon's orbit is inclined approximately 5.145 degrees to the ecliptic.

Key characteristics:
- Period: ~4.5 years (half the nodal regression period)
- Amplitude: ~0.116 degrees (about 7 arcminutes)
- Argument: 2(F - M') = 2*omega (twice the argument of perigee)
- Cause: projection of inclined orbital plane onto ecliptic

The reduction to ecliptic correction term in True Lilith is:
    -tan^2(i/2) * sin(2*omega)
where i = 5.145 degrees (lunar inclination) and omega = F - M' (argument of perigee).
