"""
Tests for enhanced calc_mean_lilith() formula with T⁴ term and periodic corrections.

The enhanced formula includes:
- T⁴ term from Swiss Ephemeris source (+ T⁴/3526000)
- Periodic corrections for solar/lunar perturbations on mean apsidal motion

Expected improvement: reduce error from ~270 arcsec to <100 arcsec compared
to Swiss Ephemeris reference across the 1800-2200 range.
