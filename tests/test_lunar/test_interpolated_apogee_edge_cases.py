"""
Tests for edge cases in the interpolated lunar apogee calculation.

Edge cases tested:
1. 360/0 degree wrapping: When the apogee crosses the 0/360 boundary during
   the interpolation window, the unwrapping logic must handle it correctly.

2. Ephemeris boundary dates: When the target date is within 28 days of the
   ephemeris boundary, the sampling window must be adjusted to stay within
   the valid ephemeris range.
