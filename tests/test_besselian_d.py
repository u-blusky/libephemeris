"""
Tests for calc_besselian_d function in libephemeris.

Tests the Besselian d (declination) calculation for solar eclipses.

The Besselian element d is the declination of the Moon's shadow axis,
measured in degrees. This is the angle between the shadow axis direction
and the celestial equatorial plane.
