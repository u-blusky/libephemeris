"""
Crossing event calculations for libephemeris.

Finds exact times when the Sun or Moon cross specific ecliptic longitudes.
Uses Newton-Raphson iteration for sub-arcsecond precision.

Functions:
- swe_solcross_ut: Sun crossing events (e.g., ingresses, equinoxes)
- swe_mooncross_ut: Moon crossing events (for lunar mansion calculations)
- swe_cross_ut: Generic planet crossing

FIXME: Precision - Newton-Raphson convergence tolerance
Current tolerance: 1 arcsecond (1/3600°)
Iterations: 20-30 max
Typical convergence: 3-6 iterations for Sun, 5-10 for Moon

For sub-arcsecond precision, consider iterative refinement or
use Swiss Ephemeris swe_solcross_ut2 with higher tolerances.

Algorithm: Initial linear estimate + Newton-Raphson refinement
