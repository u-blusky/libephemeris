Tests for Co-Ascendant (Walter Koch) and related angle calculations.

Tests the ascmc[4] through ascmc[7] outputs from swe_houses_ex2:
- ascmc[4]: Equatorial Ascendant (East Point)
- ascmc[5]: Co-Ascendant (Walter Koch formula)
- ascmc[6]: Co-Ascendant (Michael Munkasey formula)
- ascmc[7]: Polar Ascendant

These are astrological sensitive points related to the Ascendant
calculated using modified pole heights or ARMC offsets.
