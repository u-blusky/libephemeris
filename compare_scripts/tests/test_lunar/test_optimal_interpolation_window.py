"""
Tests for the optimal interpolation window configuration for lunar apogee.

The interpolation parameters were determined through extensive testing:
- 9 sample points (previously 7)
- 56-day window / 2 synodic months (previously 14 days)
- Linear polynomial fit (previously quadratic)

These parameters provide:
- Better smoothness: variance ~0.56 vs ~37.64 for previous settings
- Closer Swiss Ephemeris match: ~8.56° mean diff vs ~11.68° previously

Note: The ~8-10° difference from Swiss Ephemeris is fundamental and cannot
be eliminated through parameter tuning because:
1. Swiss Ephemeris uses Moshier's analytical lunar theory for osculating elements
2. LibEphemeris uses JPL DE ephemeris state vectors

The tests verify:
1. The new parameters produce smoother curves
2. Basic functionality is preserved
3. Reasonable agreement with Swiss Ephemeris (where available)
