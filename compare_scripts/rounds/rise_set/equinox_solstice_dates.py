"""Round 167: Rise/set at equinox and solstice dates.

Tests rise_trans at astronomically significant dates (equinoxes, solstices)
where the Sun's declination is at extremes or zero. These are dates where
the day/night balance is changing rapidly and edge cases in rise/set
calculations are most likely to surface.
